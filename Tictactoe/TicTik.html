      <!-- Information on how to play the game goes here -->
      Tic-Tac-Toe Rules:<br>
Objective: The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to form a line of three of your marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board.
<br>Game Board: Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid, creating a total of nine spaces for placing your marks.
<br>Players: The game is typically played by two players. One player uses "X," and the other player uses "O."
<br>Turns: Players take turns to place their mark on the game board, starting with "X."
<br>Winning: A player wins the game when they successfully create a line of three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. When this happens, the game ends, and the winning player is declared.
<br>Draw: If all the spaces on the board are filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is declared a draw, and it is over.
<br>Strategy: Players try to block their opponent from forming a winning line while also attempting to create their own winning lines.
<br>Ending the Game: The game ends when a player wins or when a draw is declared. Players can choose to play multiple rounds.
<br>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game that is often used to introduce strategy and critical thinking to players of all ages. The game's straightforward rules make it a popular choice for quick and fun entertainment.
